# Guiding Principles

Harbor operates under the guiding principles described below. The Committee is responsible for upholding these principles and keeping this document updated with any changes. They do that by participating in the Harbor community and keeping a good pulse of all interactions. The Committee cannot unilaterally make decisions, but can instead make recomendations to the Harbor maintainers and community. Issues will be tracked with PRs and follow the proper approval process. The Committee can also flag issues in community calls for further discussion and brainstorming. 

# Mission Statement

*“To be the most secure, performant, scalable, and available cloud native repository for Kubernetes.”*

# Vision

The vision of the Harbor project is to deliver policy, security, and compliance for container images, Helm Charts, and other cloud native artifacts to the cloud native community. Success metrics include gaining popularity and widespread adoption.

# Values

Harbor is driven by high technical standards, and these must be maintained. It is also important to take into account that multiple humans are participating in the project, and we must ensure that we all treat each other well. In this respect, we will honor the following values:

* Technical excellence
* Innovation and creativity
* Fairness and equality
* Diversity
* Inclusiveness
* Openness
* Adherence to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/goharbor/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

# Committee

Harbor does not have a specialized Committee to uphold the values and guiding principles of the project. The project [maintainers](https://github.com/goharbor/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) are responsible for the overall health, technical architecture, and direction of Harbor and making sure Harbor is well-operated. Along with our Open Source Community Manager, Jonas Rosland ([jonasrosland](https://github.com/jonasrosland)), they should monitor all Harbor community activities and ensure we honor our values and principles in every interaction. Any Harbor community member, including maintainers, contributors, and users, can flag situations or instances that go against our guiding principles. The Committee can assign anyone from the community to investigate and discuss the issue so that we can resolve it. Such discussions can happen in community calls or specialized one-off meetings.
